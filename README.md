# Description

This basic create-react-app is a portfolio built and maintained with react, hosted on github pages.io.  With the purpose of displaying projects and the root technologies used to develop them.  The Projects section images will link you to the live production sites and buttons will take you to the repositories.  There is a Technologies section that gives a broad sweep on the React, MongoDB, Express and Node.js (MERN stack) that are used to develop/run the projects and this site as well.  There is an email-me section where you can send me a message.  The icons in the footer will direct you to my LinkedIn, GitHub repository, Contact Form & allow you to download my current resume.  

# About

The app uses react to render the html and takes advantage of react based components to deliver.  I am using parallax images for the container backgrounds and formSpree to deliver on the emails.  I chose photos for the parallax images from some of my favorite places in the united states.
